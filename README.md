# Theory:

Correlation describes the strength of an association between two variables, and is completely symmetrical, the correlation between A and B is the same as the correlation between B and A. However, if the two variables are related it means that when one changes by a certain amount the other changes on an average by a certain amount.  If y represents the dependent variable and x the independent variable, this relationship is described as the regression of y on x.
The relationship can be represented by a simple equation called the regression equation. In this context “regression” simply means that the average value of y is a “function” of x, that is, it changes with x.
The regression equation representing how much y changes with any given change of x can be used to construct a regression line on a scatter diagram, and in the simplest case this is assumed to be a straight line. The direction in which the line slopes depends on whether the correlation is positive or negative. When the two sets of observations increase or decrease together (positive) the line slopes upwards from left to right; when one set decreases as the other increases the line slopes downwards from left to right. As the line must be straight, it will probably pass through few, if any, of the dots.
